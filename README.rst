Hildegard
=========

The *hildegard* program is a hierarchic layout and design environment
for generating applications and rendering diagrams.  This graphical
schematic editor will eventually enable the construction of hierarchic
software components and applications by drawing block diagrams.  This
project is in its infancy, so it doesn't do much yet.

This tool requires *qtpy* and *libavoid* (from the *adaptagrams*
project), so you must install these Python 3 libraries prior to
running *hildegard*.  Instructions on installing *libavoid* can be
found in the `kivytest README file`_.  On Ubuntu 18.04, *qtpy* can be
installed like this: ::

  sudo apt-get install python3-qtpy
