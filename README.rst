Graphical System Designer (gsd)
===============================

The *gsd* program is a graphical system design tool (block diagram
schematic editor) that will enable the construction of hierarchic
software components.  This project is in its infancy, so it doesn't do
much yet.

This tool requires *kivy* and *libavoid* (from the *adaptagrams*
project), so you must install these Python libraries prior to running
*gsd*.  Instructions on installing these prerequisites can be found in
the `kivytest README file`_.
